README: Game of Life - HTML5-Canvas/Javascript Code Test

This was a prototype written for a code test using Javascript and leverages the HTML5 Canvas object.

There is also a basic unit test kit (QUnit) included which will validate some of the JS functionality.

Load the HTML page (goljs.html) to run the code.  This will run the game as well as the QUnit test modules.

You can choose to Auto-populate the grid or do so manually by clicking on individual cells.

There are also 3 options you have to control the population!

1. Minimum neighbors: this option determines how many neighbors a living cell must have to survive to the next generation
2. Maximum neighbors: this option determines the maximum number of neighbors a living cell can have before it is overcrowded and dies
3. Spawn neighbors: this option determines how many neighbors a dead cell must have before it can become ALIIIIVEE!

Have fun!
